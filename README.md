The dataset contains information of 113,937 loans given. There are eighty-one attributes on each loan.

In the data wrangling steps, loans after July 2009 was used since it contains attributes of interest.


## Summary of Findings
In the exploration, I noticed that 36 loan term was twice as many of combined 60 loan term and 12 loan term.

California state had the highest the number of borrowers and most loans was for debt consolidation.

Prosper Rating had a symmetric and unimodal distribution. The highest peak was at 'C'.

From C - AA in the Prosper rating, we tend to find more homeowners than non-homeowners. From HR - D Prosper rating, non-homeowners are more than homeowners.

The number of loan increase from year to year but there was a significant decrease prior to early 2013 which later saw a sharp increase. The average borrower APR has being decreasing since 2012.

The monthly loan payment is very high for 12 loan term, followed by the 36 loan term which is followed closely by the 60 loan term.
